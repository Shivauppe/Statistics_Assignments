        "The normal distribution is characterized by its bell shape, symmetry, and the relationship between the mean and standard deviation. The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule) provides a quick way to estimate how much data lies within certain distances (standard deviations) from the mean. This rule is particularly useful for understanding how data is spread in many natural phenomena, such as test scores, height, weight, and measurement errors."
